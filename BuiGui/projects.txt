1. Choose a biological relevant subject where a bioinformatics / computational biology program 
can solve at least a small part of the problem / research question.

Subjects : 
    1. Computational neuroscience
        1.1. Single neuron modelling

        Hence there is a drive to produce simplified neuron models that can retain significant biological fidelity at a 
        low computational overhead. Algorithms have been developed to produce faithful, faster running, simplified 
        surrogate neuron models from computationally expensive, detailed neuron models.

        1.2. The Blue Brain project (EFPL)

        1.3. Python implementation of NEURON / GENESIS

        1.4. NeuroMorphoVis (In combinatie met blender!!)
        
        1.6. Neurodegenerative disorders (Huntington, Parkinson, ALS)

        1.7. Brain wave (EEG) interpretation to diagnose brain disorders

    2. Medicine and Physiology
        2.2 - Machine learning image processing x-ray scans of thorax

    3. Species simulation

    4. Genetic / Evolutionary Algorithms

    5. Cellular automata
